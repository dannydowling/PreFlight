The Server:

The server handles the logic for the application.
It runs the controller actions on the database that stores information from the models like Location and Weather.

it also runs the processing of distance calculations and the backend processing that are the main business logic of the app.

In general, if a client asks for information once they're logged into the app, the server should provide it.
