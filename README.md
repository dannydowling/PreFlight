Thanks for clicking the link and checking out the page.

I'm ambitious for this website. I own the Preflight.AI domain and I have some things I'm trying to solve.

1. Better Fuel Planning for trips. Like being able to put in a destination and how much weight has been added.
  Then having the website give better values for fuel quantity required. Making things easier than they are.
  To accomplish this, I'll need weather information, I'll need fuel weight and tracking of aircraft load and efficiency.
  
2. I'd like the website to offer collaborative NOTAMS. Notices to Airmen are charts that tell of features used to guide 
  approaches in flight, they're also spoken to pilots from the control tower to keep them aware of things. 
  I'd like to overlay google maps with NOTAM symbols.

3. I plan to hire a designer. I'm okay at the functionality side of things but the website isn't very fancy.
    In that I see real business type potential for the site, I plan to hire a designer when I can afford to soon.
